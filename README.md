# 🫁 Pneumonia Detection from Chest X-Rays

This project implements a deep learning model to detect **Pneumonia** from chest X-ray images. It uses Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) for image classification and is trained on the **[Kaggle Chest X-Ray Pneumonia dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/paultimothymooney/chest-xray-pneumonia)**.

---

## 🚀 Project Overview

- **Goal:** Classify X-ray images as *Normal* or *Pneumonia*.
- **Dataset:** 5,863 chest X-ray images (train, test, val) from Kaggle.
- **Model:** CNN built using TensorFlow/Keras.
- **Metrics:** Accuracy, Precision, Recall, F1-score.

## 🧠 Key Features

- Preprocessing and data augmentation using `ImageDataGenerator`.
- CNN architecture optimized for binary classification.
- Evaluation on unseen X-ray images.
- Trained model can be reused for inference or deployment.
